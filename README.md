## IHCP solver based on the function specification method to calculate unknown heat transfer coefficients

Explanation of the maths involved in this can be found in the .pdf.
To use this code, place the data file (.dat, .csv, .txt, etc.) in this directory, change the filenames in upstreamdownstream.m and main.m, and run upstreamdownstream.m then main.m.

Column headings in the data file should be: pos, load, time, T_oven, T_Cu1, T_Cu2, T_Inco1, T_H25, T_Inco2, T_Cu3, T_Cu4.
